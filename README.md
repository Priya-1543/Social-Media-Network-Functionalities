# Social-Media-Network-Functionalities
I have created a program on Social Network Functionalities using the
best suitable data structures and optimum time complexity. 

`

**functionalities :**
- Adding users to the network.
- Adding friends to the user's friend list.
- Displaying friend list.
- Finding mutual friends.
- Find a user who has the highest number of friends.

`

**Data Structure Used -**
-Graph Implementation using a linked list of linked lists.
-Singly Linked List.

`

**Time Complexity -**
- Quick sort has been used to find mutual friends - O(n^2) for worst case and O(nlogn) for average case.
- To find a member with maximum friends - O(n).
- Adding members in the network - O(1).
- Adding friends of the members - O(n).
- Displaying friend list - O(n^2).
